# Flight Booker
The goal of this project was to create a one-way flight booking system on Rails. The flow of the system is as follows:

1. Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
2. Choose from among a list of eligible flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers
4. View created booking
5. A booking confirmation email with deatails about the booking is sent to each passenger using the email provided on the booking form.

Since the project's focus was on creating nested forms and the database, the website has no styling and is in plain html.

The project was created as part of The Odin Project - Ruby On Rails - BUILDING ADVANCED FORMS, which can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms
